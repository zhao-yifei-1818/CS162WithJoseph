5 topics that interested me in relation to computers:
 
-AI: Knowing there would be some certain way to set a computer interacting with people or do machine learning it got me interested.
 
-Gaming: Playing video game is some cool experience, also I believe it would be fantastic to create one.
 
-Big Data: Comparing to the way human do things computer has a advantage of consuming lot raw status and trasferring it to more useful information. If coded properly.
 
-Visual effects: I know some game engines like FrostBite and Unreal. You create visual effects, and you may create engine that creates visual effects.  There's gotta be some fun doing it.
 
-Internet: A huge human built web that contains lots of information. Internet is a wild world that people do man vs wild online.

5 topics that I find or think will be challenging in relation to computers:
 
-Putting ideas into actual codes is challenging.

-Code checking is challenging. Sometimes you know there is a problem but it is hard to find where to fix.

-Revising and Learning take multiple practices and time

-Get program work with other programs.

-To design a set of self-learning machines is very challenging. Respect those AI-designers!
